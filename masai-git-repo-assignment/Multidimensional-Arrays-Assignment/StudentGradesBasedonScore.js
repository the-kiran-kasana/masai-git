// Problem Statement:

// Write a program that classifies students based on their scores stored in an object. The object contains student names as keys and their scores as values. You need to print each studentâ€™s name along with their grade based on the following conditions:

let studentScores = {
    John: 85,
    Emma: 92,
    Sam: 67,
    Bob: 45
  };
  
for(let Score in studentScores)  
{
    if(studentScores[Score] >= 90)
    {
       console.log(Score + " A")
    }
    else{
        if((studentScores[Score] >= 80) && (studentScores[Score] < 90))
        {
            console.log(Score + " B")
        }
        else{
            if((studentScores[Score] >= 70) && (studentScores[Score] < 80))
            {
                console.log(Score + " C")
            }
            else{
                if((studentScores[Score] >= 60) && (studentScores[Score] < 70))
                {
                    console.log(Score + " D")
                }
                else{
                    if(studentScores[Score] < 60 )
                    {
                        console.log(Score + " F")
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
